# A lightweight, all-in-one YouTube client for Windows
YouTube Downloader is a user-friendly, feature-rich Windows client that allows YouTube videos to be _downloaded_ and _watched_ in high-quality.
## Project Status
⚠️ **NON-FUNCTIONAL | DEVELOPMENT INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED — YouTube endpoint modifications mean that the YoutubeExplode API (which this project depends on) no longer returns search results. As soon as this issue is rectified (out of my control), this project will be updated with the latest API version and code adjustments to ensure it works correctly again.**
